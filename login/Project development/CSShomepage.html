        <p><h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS.
             It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages
              presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of
               the HTML that makes up each web page.</h4></p>
        <h2>Why we learn CSS?</h2>
        <p><h4>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes
             it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to 
             interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.</h4></p>
